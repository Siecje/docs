Differences from MarkDown
-------------------------

* Tabs or 4+ spaces are used to separate two-column lists

  ```
  - line	cells with border (default)
  - clean	cells without border
  - wide	cells with border and small space between siblings
  - space	cells with border and wide space between siblings
  - head	similar to "wide", but there is any border between the first and second cells
  ```

* triple-tilde, `~~~` is used instead of <code>```</code> for code sections

<pre>
    ~~~js
    webix.ui({
        view: "list",
        template: "#title#"
    }); // this list will show 'titles'
    ~~~
</pre>

Autogenerated files
-------------------

There's no use to edit "ref" pages (files containing "refs" in the path). They are autogenerated from `@short` sections of articles, so it is enough to edit the `@short` section of the related article.
