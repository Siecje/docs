Managing Data in a Component
====================
Here you learn how to present and process data with the help of dedicated [components](desktop/components.md) differing in look and feel yet similar 
in functionality. They are as follows: 

 [Chart](desktop/chart.md), [Datatable](datatable/index.md), [Dataview](desktop/dataview.md),
 [Grouplist](desktop/grouplist.md), [List](desktop/list.md), [Property Sheet](desktop/property_sheet.md),
 [Tree](datatree/index.md), [Treetable](desktop/treetable.md), [Unitlist](desktop/unitlist.md)
