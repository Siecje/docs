Version 4.2
=============

<span class="release_date">released on February 23, 2017</span>

See also spreadsheet/whats_new.md


Breaking Changes
------------------

- Access to [third-party components'](desktop/extensions.md) objects (charts, maps, scheduler) has changed. 
Now the only way to receive the component's object is to call the related **getChart/getMap/getEditor/getScheduler()** method.

It is also possible to force this method return a promise by passing the *true* parameter. The promise will resolve when the chart, map, editor 
or scheduler is loaded and ready to use.

- One of the [third-party components](desktop/extensions.md) has changed its name. Now we have an updated HereMap instead of the NokiaMap. 

- Breaking change for the [Skin Builder](http://webix.com/skin-builder/) users. New properties are added into the *config.js* files of skins.
Please check [the list of new properties](desktop/skins.md#skinjsfileconfig) and add the missing ones to your custom skin js 
file generated with Skin Builder to avoid possible breakdowns.

Check the [Migration Guide](migration.md#webix4042) for more details.
