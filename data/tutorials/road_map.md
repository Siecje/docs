For understanding the basic concepts and getting the desired information in the most convenient way we offer you to follow this road map:

1. desktop/compatibility.md - lets you find out whether your development tools satisfy the library requirements.
2. **Getting Started** - gives essential notes that will help you to create your first Webix-based application.
  - tutorials/start_coding.md - says about  fundamental principles and covers development process from planning to coding.
  - tutorials/quick_start.md - links to a short article that will teach you how to easily get a simple application up and running.
  - tutorials/basic_app.md - introduces a detail tutorial that takes a bit more time but cover all nuts-and-bolts of the library

5. helpers/index.md - covers advanced techniques implemented by means of helper components. Mostly intended for expert developers to customize the existent functionality.
