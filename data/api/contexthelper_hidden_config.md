hidden
=============


@short: sets the initial visibility of the context object. *True* by default.
	

@type: bool
@example:


@template:	api_config
@descr:

The property is initially **true** and setting it to *false* doesn't make much matter since the meaning of the context object 
is its visibility only on right mouse clicking.
