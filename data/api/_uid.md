uid
=============


@short: returns a unique id

@returns:
- id	id	a unique id	

@example:
var id = webix.uid();

@template:	api_method
@descr:

The generated id is unique per page but **not** globally. <br>  So you can use the method in the on-page logic. It's not good enough for use as the DB id.
