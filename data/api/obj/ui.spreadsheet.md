{{memo a component for organizing, working with and storing data in tabular form }}

Webix SpreadSheet allows creating tables online, while keeping data locally. It's possible to import a ready table into
an Excel document or export a table from Excel. The tables' appearance can be easily changed: you can customize the styles of colors, fonts and borders, set the necessary vertical and horizontal aligns, merge cells, rows and columns.

The component provides a built-in functionality for mathematical expressions and supports resizing and localization of tables.

Check desktop/spreadsheet.md documentation for more information.
