{{memo a slider component with two markers for selecting a range of values}}

Unlike a standard slider, this control allows choosing a particular range of values due to its two handlers. The part of the value line which corresponds to the selected set of values is highlighted in blue color.

Check [rangeslider](desktop/controls.md#range) documentation for more detailed description.
