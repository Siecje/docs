Getting started with DataTable
=================
To make a great app you need to learn different things but if you're new to DataTable you might be wondering where to begin. 

{{note
Some platforms (Java, .Net, PHP)  get ready-to-use solutions for data loading, saving, exporting.

For understanding the basic concepts and getting the desired information in the most convenient way we offer you to follow this road map:

1. [Tutorial](datatable/quick_start.md) - gives essential notes you should know to create the first DataTable-based application.
2. **Detailed guidelines** - the main chapter of the documentation covering the developer-oriented tasks in details.
  - [Configuration](datatable/configuration.md) - explains how to configure a table: to specify and size required columns, set headers(footers) for them, populate the table with data and etc.  
  - [Look and Feel](datatable/look_and_feel.md) - tells you how to fine-tune the appearance of your table and data in it with the help of CSS classes, templates and special modes.
  - [Operations with data](datatable/operations_with_data.md) - covers techniques for performing general operations under data in DataTable, such as sorting, filtering, copy-pasting and selection.
  - [Operations with cells](datatable/get_set_data.md) - describes basic operations you surely will use while developing: getting/setting the value of a cell.
  - [Integration](datatable/integration.md) - says which libraries and how can be integrated with DataTable.
  - [Data export to PDF, Excel](datatable/export.md) - shows the process of exporting data from DataTable to PDF and Excel documents. 
  - [Saving data on server](desktop/serverside.md) - describes server-side work.
3. [Events handling](datatable/events_handling.md) - says how to use events: to attach and detach, which events can be handled and how.
4. [API Reference](api/refs/ui.datatable.md) - provides reference information you need for coding: all the available methods, parameters and events of the library.
