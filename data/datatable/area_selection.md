Area Selection in DataTable
=============================

Webix DataTable features Excel-like area selection. You can click on any cell in the DataTable and move the mouse pointer over the grid, a block of cells will be selected and colored in gray.

When you release the mouse pointer, the selection will remain and marked with bold border with a handle, like this:

To enable area selection in DataTable, you should specify the **areaselect** property with the *true* value in the datatable configuration.

~~~js
{
	view:"datatable",
	id: "table",
	columns:[
		{ id:"rank",	header:"", css:"rank",  width:50},
		{ id:"title",	header:"Film title", 	width:200},
		{ id:"year",	header:"Released", 		width:80},
		{ id:"votes",	header:"Votes", 		width:120},
		{ id:"rating",	header:"Rating", 		width:80},
	],
	areaselect:true,		/*!*/
	data:small_film_set
}
~~~

{{note Area selection will work only with other selection types disabled. So, the *select* property shouldn't be set.}}

Custom Select Area
-------------------

<h3 id="details">Adding Custom Select Area</h3>

You can apply custom area selection in the DataTable. 

<img src="datatable/custom_selection.png">

For this purpose, you need to use the api/ui.datatable_addselectarea.md method.
This method allows creating a custom select area. 

~~~js
$$("dtable").addSelectArea(start,end,preserve);
~~~

The parameters are:

- start	- (object) the id object of the left top cell, contains two parameters: the row id and the column id
- end - (object) the id object of the right cell, contains two parameters: the row id and the column id
- preserve - (boolean)	defines, if the previous select area should be saved, false by default
- area_name - (string)	optional, the name used to address to an area to change or to delete it; by default it's generated by the uid() method
- css - (string) optional, the css style (className) for the border of an area. By default, the border of area selection is black
- handle - (boolean) optional, enables/disables a handle for selection area resize (enabled by default)

The first three parameters are mandatory, all others are optional.

###Removing Select Area

You can easily remove an unnecessary select area by using the api/ui.datatable_removeselectarea.md method.

~~~js
$$("dtable").removeSelectArea();
~~~

To remove some particular select area, you need to pass its name as a parameter of the removeSelectArea().
If the name isn't passed to the method, it will remove the last unnamed select area.


###Getting Select Area

To get a select area, you should make use of the api/ui.datatable_getselectarea.md method. 
The method returns the object of the select area.

~~~js
var area = $$("dtable").getSelectArea();
~~~

The object of a certain select area can be received by passing the name of the area as a parameter. 
Without parameters, the method returns the object of the last select area. 

The returned object will contain the mandatory parameters: start, end and preserve. It can also include the optional parameters: 
area_name, css and handle. The details on the parameters are given <a href="#details">here</a>.

###Multiple Area Selection

Several areas can be selected in the DataTable at once. The image below illustrates this feature:

To enable multiple selection, you need to define the multiselect property with the true value in the 
Datatable configuration:

~~~js
{
	view:"datatable",
	id: "table",
	columns:[
		{ id:"rank",	header:"", css:"rank",  width:50},
		{ id:"title",	header:"Film title", 	width:200},
		{ id:"year",	header:"Released", 		width:80},
		{ id:"votes",	header:"Votes", 		width:120},
		{ id:"rating",	header:"Rating", 		width:80},
	],
	areaselect:true,		
    multiselect:true,						/*!*/
	data:small_film_set
}
~~~

While having several select areas in the datatable, you can get all of them at once. For this purpose, apply the api/ui.datatable_getallselectareas.md method:

~~~js
var areas = $$("dtable").getAllSelectAreas();
~~~

The method returns an object that contains configuration objects of all select areas in the datatable.
The parameters of area objects are described <a href="#details">above</a>.
